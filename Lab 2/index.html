                    <p>Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday charged the government with not being able to keep its promises. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi wanted to create a ‘Swachch Bharat’ but people wanted a ‘sach Bharat’. Wherever he goes, he lies, Mr. Gandhi alleged.

Addressing a meeting of Opposition leaders, hosted by rebel Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav, he also took a dig at the government’s flagship programme ‘Make in India’, saying most products available in the country were made in China.</p>
